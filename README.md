# javascript-parallax-bg

Project Overview:
Given backgrounds designed for repeatable scrolling, this program will demonstrate smooth scrolling at a configurable speed.
HTML, CSS, JS

What I learned:
Loading in images using the built in Image object
Using "load" eventListener to ensure parts of the script only begin after the window is loaded in
Using a JS class in relation to drawing and updating a Canvas, and using a speed variable within each object to create parallax scrolling
The idea behind how parallax scrolling works (Scroll through the entire image, plus the canvas width, then drawImage back at x:0)
